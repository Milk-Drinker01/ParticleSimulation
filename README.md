# ParticleSimulation
a simple particle attraction simulation in unity using compute shaders


a shitty WIP particle simulator in unity written by me. every single particle is attracted to every other particle, and the attractiveness to each type of particle is configurable.

note: this isnt meant to be used as a gpu particle system, but rather an innacurate simulation for simulating gravity/attraction between particles. it isnt really practical in any way, and was written in about 4 hours for the core functionality, and about 4 more for cleanup/features.

included in this project is a single compute shader and a single script.

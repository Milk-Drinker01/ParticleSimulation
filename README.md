# ParticleSimulation
a simple particle attraction simulation in unity using compute shaders


a shitty WIP particle simulator in unity written by me. every single particle is attracted to every other particle, and the attractiveness to each type of particle is configurable.

included in this project is a single compute shader and a single script.
